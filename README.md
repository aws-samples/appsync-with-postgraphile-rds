# Autogenerated AppSync API using Postgraphile and RDS Postgres database

![A diagram of the architecture solution Overview](./images/overview.png "Solution Overview")

> TODO: Overview

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/appsync-with-postgraphile-rds.git
cd appsync-with-postgraphile-rds
npm install
```

## VPC with RDS (optional step)

If you do not have an existing PostgreSQL RDS, the **vpc-with-pg** app will deploy a VPC with public and private subnets with NAT Gateway and provision an RDS instance into the private subnet.

### Deploy

```sh
cd ./vpc-with-pg
npm run cdk deploy -- --all -O output.json
cd ..
```

### Loading the database (optional)

> TODO: add sample data

## The solution

To deploy the solution into an existing vpc with RDS, or after **vpc-with-pg**.

You must use RDS Proxy with IAM authorization.
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy.html>

## Deploy the solution

Use the `deploy` script to help configure your context and parameters. The script uses values from **vpc-with-pg**'s `output.json`.

```bash
cd ./pg-with-graphile
npm run deploy -- --username <username> --database <database> --schemas <schemas>
```

After deployment, run the `update` script to update your API and create your schema cache layer

```bash
npm run update
```

Done.

## Clean up

When you are done with the solution, you can delete your resources by running the scripts below.

```sh
cd ./pg-with-graphile
npm run cdk destroy
cd ./vpc-with-pg
npm run cdk destroy -- --all
```
